# A brief introduction to purrr

These are the notes and code from a brief presentation I made at an "unconference" for R-inclined journalists. You can read the notes in [script.md](/script.md) or try some of the code yourself in [script.Rmd](/script.Rmd).

Questions? Comments? Errors? Contact me at ryanvmenezes@gmail.com, @ryanvmenezes on Twitter or in the [News Nerdery](https://newsnerdery.org/) Slack (where the idea for this conference originated). Thanks for reading and I hope this was helpful.
